    <p>　　　ENHYPEN is an idol group consisting of 7 males selected from the global idol project "I-LAND", which was held to nurture the next generation of idol groups. ENHYPEN was born from the survival audition program "I-LAND" that was broadcasted from June 2020.
ENHYPEN was born out of the survival audition show "I-LAND", which aired from June 2020 and was a major project by Big Hit Entertainment (now HYBE), to which BTS belongs, and CJ ENM, which produces the Korean audition show "PRODUCE".
It was produced at a cost of about 2 billion yen and was viewed in 181 countries around the world. The selection process for this audition was grueling, with 23 participants chosen by producer Pang Si-hyuk, and the participants choosing each other to be demoted.They were narrowed down to twelve, and finally, seven members of ENHYPEN were chosen by the producers' evaluation and the viewers' votes.
</p>      
    <p>　　　The group's name, "ENHYPEN", as the symbol "hyphen" implies, means that the seven boys with completely different personalities will connect, discover each other, and grow together. It also has the idea of uniting people with people and the world with the world through music.</p>

    
    <p>　　　The fandom is called "ENGENE".This fan name was invented by the fans, and ENGENE has the meaning of "the fans will be the major driving force for the growth and development of ENHYPEN" as the intuitive image, and also the idea that ENHYPEN and the fans will connect, develop and grow together while sharing genes (GENE) with each other.</p>


    <p>　　　ENHYPEN is a seven-member multinational group consisting of Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Niki, with members hailing from America, Australia, and Japan in addition to Korea.</p>

    <p>　　　ENHYPEN, whose youngest member Niki is Japanese, made their debut in Japan in July 2021, and have been active in Japan, serving as regular personalities on All Night Nippon X Mondays, and in the Nippon Television Corporation Wednesday drama "Muchaburi!" ENHYPEN is attracting a lot of attention in Japan as well.</p>

     <p>　　　He's Sunoo, the member I'm most in favor of in this group. He is a senior in high school, born in 2004. He has an impressive smile that captures the hearts of everyone who sees him.
Normally, Sunoo looks cute and charming, but when he's on stage, he has a variety of expressions that change with each song.</p>
